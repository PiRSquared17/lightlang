- more good solution for lang table: put table also here, convert to not std::pair array
- handle ['] tag in dsl
- xml -> text when converting to stardict and dictd
- do not use `exit' to terminate program

- xdxf_parser - how report about error?
- dsl: for what used dict.utr files?

- Use cmake build system:
	- building and using test - done
	- installing: makedict, plugins, man page - done
	- build source dump - done
	- remove autotools stuff - done
